Prompting is becoming a core skill for the future of work.

At Prompt Alchemist, I help founders, working adults and students learn how to talk to AI tools properly, so they can save time and get better results.

If you’ve ever stared at a blank chat box not knowing what to type, I’ll show you simple prompt frameworks you can use right away.

Follow along if you want to turn AI into a real teammate, not just a toy.

Most people talk *to* AI like this: "Write something good."

Then they wonder why the output is mid.

The problem isn’t the AI. It’s the *prompt*.

At Prompt Alchemist, we help founders, working adults and students learn how to “speak AI’s language” — using clear roles, tasks and tones so they get sharp, usable results instead of vague replies.

If you’ve ever stared at a blank chat box not knowing what to type, we’ll show you simple prompt frameworks you can use right away.

If you want to turn AI into a real teammate (not just a toy), join our community to learn the best prompting techniques.
