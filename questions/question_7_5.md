## Prompt for Social Media Post Creation

As an experienced social media marketer with over 25 years of experience in the AI + Education space, you have unique insights and strategies that are most effective for a company in this sector, especially one specialising in **prompt engineering workshops, digital courses, and digital products (PDFs and course materials)**.

Can you write for me **at least 3 social media posts** based on the following:

- **Industry Type:** AI + Education – specialising in prompt engineering workshops, digital courses, and digital products (PDFs and course materials).
- **Target Audience:** Primary: founders, solopreneurs, and working professionals aged 23–45 in Singapore and nearby countries. Secondary: polytechnic and university students aged 19–25 who are curious about AI, productivity, and the future of work, and who believe in upskilling.
- **Social Media Platform:** LinkedIn (main), YouTube, and Instagram.
- **Social Media Content Type:** LinkedIn text posts and carousels; YouTube tutorial videos and short clips; Instagram Reels and simple static posts.
- **Social Media Image Design Idea:** Clean, minimalist visuals with bold, modern colours; screenshots of AI chats showing prompts and outputs; simple diagrams or frameworks about prompting; consistent Prompt Alchemist colours and fonts.
- **Unique Selling Points (USPs):** Focus on prompting as a core future-of-work skill; practical, step-by-step teaching with real use cases; designed for busy founders, professionals, and students who want quick results; mix of live workshops, digital courses, and PDFs; clear, friendly, non-chim explanations that make AI feel less scary and more useful.

Each of the social media posts should contain the following:

- **Attention-grabbing first sentence (hook):** Can be a problem, desire, or preferred end state ("imagine this").
- **Details of the offer / content:** Craft the exact copy focused on what people can stand to benefit from. Keep this light and easy to read.
- **Call to Action:** Clear and simple next step.
- **Design brief:** Short notes to brief designers (keep it simple).
- **Language style:** Be enthusiastic but not overselling. Keep it factual and sincere, without sounding like a used-car salesperson.

Alternatively, can you distil the above points from the write-up on the company I’ve pasted below?
